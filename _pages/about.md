I'm an industrial PhD student at KTH Royal Insitute of Technlogy and employed by SEB. I am part of the Wallenberg Artificial Intelligence, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP), specifically WASP-AS batch 3. Prof. [Florian Pokorny](https://www.kth.se/profile/fpokorny) is supervising my thesis and Salla Franz√©n is my manager at SEB.

My research relates to advanced analytics for anti money laundering.
Specifically, I'm interested in how recent advanced in machine learning and topological data analysis can be applied to financial transaction data for discovery of money laundering schemes.
Each year [a vast amount of dirty money](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/faq/moneylaundering/) is laundered through the financial systems and financial insitutions are under preasure to address this. 
The problem of discovering such schemes nevertheless remains very challenging from a machine learning perspective due to lack of labelled data, large data volumes and data secrecy.

Currently I'm working on anonymization methods using deep generative models which could allow financial institutions to share data without risking to compromise customer or business secrets.
