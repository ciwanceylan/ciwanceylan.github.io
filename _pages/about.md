I'm an industrial PhD student at [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/is/rpl) and employed by [SEB](https://sebgroup.com/). I am part of the [Wallenberg Artificial Intelligence, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP)](https://wasp-sweden.org/), specifically WASP-AS batch 3. Professor [Danica Kragic](https://www.kth.se/profile/dani) is supervising my thesis and Dr. [Kambiz Ghoorchian](https://se.linkedin.com/in/kambiz-ghoorchian) is my industrial supervisor at SEB.

My research is centred around unsupervised representation learning for large graphs. Specifically, my thesis focuses on node embeddings and applications relevant for financial crime prevention, such as node classification, anomaly detection, network alignment and network flow prediction. My goal is that my research will contribute to the fight against [money laundering and terrorist financing](https://www.imf.org/external/np/leg/amlcft/eng/aml1.htm).

I am also interested in anonymization methods which can be applied to complex financial data, such as generative modelling of transaction graphs. Currently, financial institutesâ€™ ability to publicly share datasets is limited by the risk of compromising customers and leak business secrets, and anonymization methods are a first step towards overcoming these hindrances.

My research relates to advanced analytics for detecting financial crime occurring in transaction networks.
Each year [a vast amount of dirty money](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/faq/moneylaundering/) is laundered through the financial systems and financial institutions are under pressure to address this.
The problem of discovering such schemes nevertheless remains very challenging from a machine learning perspective due to lack of labelled data, large data volumes and data secrecy.
Specifically, I'm interested in how recent advances in machine learning, network science and graph signal processing can be applied to financial transaction data in order to discovery anomalous customer behaviour, which could indicate illegal activity.


Currently, I'm working on unsupervised node representation learning methods which can be used a for downstream anomaly detection.
I am also interested in anonymization methods which can be applied to transactions graphs. Such methods could allow financial institutions to share anonymized data without risking compromising customer or business secrets. -->
