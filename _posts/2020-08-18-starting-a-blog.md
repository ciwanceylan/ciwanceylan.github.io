description: My thoughts on why I would like to start a blog
---

Sometimes my head feels like it is overflowing with thoughts all going in different directions which induces a feeling of confusion over what I'm doing and where I'm heading in my daily tasks, my career and my life in general. My hope with this blog is that writing down these thoughts will help me create a structure for my thoughts and thereby help me concrete where I want. The reason to share these thoughts on the web is of course to gain fame and riches!
